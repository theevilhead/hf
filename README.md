Illuminate – A completely new micro donating Platform. Illuminate is the most efficient micro donation platform developed so far for India. This platform lets user donate few Indian Rupees for needy students.
 
This project was developed from ground up within 24 hours of hackathon - #EducationalVTUHackfest
 
How The System Works? - Two steps:
1. Needy students launch a campaign - describing the cause, sharing over social networks and more!
2. People come across the campaign via social network, offline ads, SMS invitation, etc. and donate using their mobile phone balance.
Technically, the user's balance will be reduced by some amount by the telecom company and collected into the campaign creators' name.
Why people would need this platform?
1.      There is no peer-to-peer payment system available in India for general users as there are lots of restrictions by RBI over paypal, paytm etc and other means of funds transfer.
2.      Bank transfer and cash are the only available funding mediums. No credit cards, no PayPal, no any other gateway to raise fund from hundreds of thousands of users effectively.
3.      We have understood the power of one SMS. Value added services (via SMS) is so far the most accessible to general public. They know how this kind of platform can be used.
4.      The donors will have clear picture of their funds being used for a noble cause.
 
User case Scenario:
1.      Vinay is a student from Udupi. He is a hardworking and devoted student who is very passionate about his studies. His academic record is very good. He has been the School First from past 6 years. Unfortunately, due to uncertain circumstances he could not pay his school fees. But he wants to study. Alas!!! he has no money to pay his school fees.
